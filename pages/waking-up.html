                From Sam Harris, neuroscientist and author of numerous New York
                Times bestselling books, Waking Up is for the twenty percent of
                Americans who follow no religion but who suspect that important
                truths can be found in the experiences of such figures as Jesus,
                the Buddha, Lao Tzu, Rumi, and the other saints and sages of
                history. Throughout this book, Harris argues that there is more
                to understanding reality than science and secular culture
                generally allow, and that how we pay attention to the present
                moment largely determines the quality of our lives.

                Waking Up is part memoir and part exploration of the scientific
                underpinnings of spirituality. No other book marries
                contemplative wisdom and modern science in this way, and no
                author other than Sam Harris—a scientist, philosopher, and
                famous skeptic—could write it.
