                Harry Potter has no idea how famous he is. That's because he's
                being raised by his miserable aunt and uncle who are terrified
                Harry will learn that he's really a wizard, just as his parents
                were. But everything changes when Harry is summoned to attend an
                infamous school for wizards, and he begins to discover some
                clues about his illustrious birthright. From the surprising way
                he is greeted by a lovable giant, to the unique curriculum and
                colorful faculty at his unusual school, Harry finds himself
                drawn deep inside a mystical world he never knew existed and
                closer to his own noble destiny.
