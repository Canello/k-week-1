                Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago,
                an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a
                worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far
                different--and far more satisfying--than he ever imagined.
                Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of
                listening to our hearts, of recognizing opportunity and learning
                to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most
                importantly, to follow our dreams.
